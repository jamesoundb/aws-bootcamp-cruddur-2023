# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Homework

#### [Watch How to Ask for Technical Help Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDPqmwKMP7Y&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=29)
* Very good information and helpful, I try to answer questions that people have in Discord when I can but sometimes it's hard to debug with the information that some students give. Hopefully this helps.

#### [Watch Grading Homework Summaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKAScachFgk&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=25)
* I hope I've been clear and concise here but a good example of how to be straight and to the point.

#### [Watch Week 1 Live Streamed Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJnNe5Nv4tE&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=22)
* I had to go back to watch this video after the live stream because there were some things that I missed and it moved a bit fast but after a review I got everything working correctly. One thing that I noticed was slight variations between my VS Code layout and Andrew's. Particularly in the extensions and ports sections of the IDE.
#### There is an exposed ports tab which Andrew's IDE did not have.

#### Active ports show green instead of white.

#### My postgreSQL extension comes from the same author but the icon in my IDE is totally different and it had slightly different methods of operation but I was still able to get everything to run properly.

#### [Watch Remember to Commit Your Code Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-idMgFFcpg&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=23)
* I got burned on this, I accidentally closed my workspace after the live stream without committing my code. It was ok though since I needed to go back over the video to get everything nailed down. Live and learn!

#### [Watch Chirag's Week 1 Spending Considerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAMHu1NiYoI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=24)
* Solid as always from Chirag, I've been keeping track of my Gitpod billing and I still have about 58% left for the month.

#### [Watch Ashish's Week 1 Container Security Considerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjZz4D0B-cA&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=25)
* Another good video from Ashish, learning about container escaping was interesting and it's another good example of why running things as a non-root user is the way to go.
