##### I had to go back to watch this video after the live stream because there were some things that I missed and it moved a bit fast but after a review I got everything working correctly. One thing that I noticed was slight variations between my VS Code layout and Andrew's. Particularly in the extensions and ports sections of the IDE.
##### There is an exposed ports tab which Andrew's IDE did not have.

##### Active ports show green instead of white.

##### My postgreSQL extension comes from the same author but the icon in my IDE is totally different and it had slightly different methods of operation but I was still able to get everything to run properly.

##### I got burned on this, I accidentally closed my workspace after the live stream without committing my code. It was ok though since I needed to go back over the video to get everything nailed down. Live and learn!
