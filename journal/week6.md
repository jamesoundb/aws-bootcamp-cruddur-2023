#### [Create ECR repo and push image for fronted-react-js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHmpZ5hqh1I&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=59)

* register the task definition for the frontend and created the service for the frontend using the aws cli
* rebuilt frontend image to run locally for debugging
* run the frontend locally to execute docker inspect
* realized I can't shell into the frontend with bash only sh and wrote a specific script for frontend connect
* updated the frontend task definition to include a curl health check and then registered the new task definition
* 

#### [Provision and configure Application Load Balancer along with target groups](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=HHmpZ5hqh1I&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=59) 
* created an ALB and security group for the backend and frontend containers to only listen through the ALB 
* created target groups for the ALB to reference the backend container and frontend container
