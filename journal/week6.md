* updated .gitignore file to included \*.env
* created busybox docker run script
* updated the cluster in the console to use container insights
## Homework Challenges

#### Created a cluster service create and delete script using bash and the aws cli tool. 
* I wanted to have a script that would create my frontend and backend services and another one to delete them. The script can be used to create or delete both services or just one depending on the arguments that you pass to it.
* In line with trying to keep up with maintaining all three dev environments Gitpod, Codespaces, and Local I needed to create .env files and .env.erb files for the frontend and three for the backend for all three environments. I also had to create three generate-env files for the backend and three for the frontend so they would read the correct .env.erb files to generate the correct envars depending on what environment I was using. Definitely a lot more work than I was expecting to maintain all of these but I got it working in the end.
