# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Homework

#### [Watch Week 2 Live-Stream Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GD9xCzRId4&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=30)
* I was able to follow along for most of the video but I had to watch it again because I did not have my environment setup correctly in Gitpod. I had misconfigured my .gitpod file with all my tinkering and python wasn't installed. After fixing that I was able to get the traces and spans going with HoneyComb.
   
#### [Watch Chirag Spending Considerations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W3KeqCjtDY)
* A good breakdown of spending considerations for each of the services used for distributed tracing, observability, and monitoring. I'll be sure to check my CloudWatch logs as Chirag mentioned, I don't want any surprise bills. HoneyComb is super generous on their free tier and it will be more the enough for the bootcamp.

* Ashish is great, "Logging Sucks!" that cracked me up! First thing he mentioned and he isn't wrong! It is monotonous and hopefully he is right about observability and the future. 

#### Instrument HoneyComb with OTEL

#### Instrument AWS X-Ray

#### Configure custom logger to send to CloudWatch Logs
